# PASPREFER - FINAL SUBMISSION #
# 
# The predict_outcomes function takes a data frame. The return value must
# be a data frame with two columns: nomem_encr and outcome. The nomem_encr column
# should contain the nomem_encr column from the input data frame. The outcome
# column should contain the predicted outcome for each nomem_encr. The outcome
# should be 0 (no child) or 1 (having a child).
# 
# clean_df should be used to clean (preprocess) the data.
# 
# run.R can be used to test your submission.

# List your packages here. Don't forget to update packages.R!
